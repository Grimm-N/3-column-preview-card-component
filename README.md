## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

Additional Features!
- When you click the "Learn More" button, the flip side of the card opens up, revealing the "Rent Now" button.
- Additionally, when you open a new card, the previously opened card will automatically collapse. This keeps things neat and tidy! ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
